# Mobile-app-Football-Schedule-
Football schedule and chat

Created a mobile web app for Northside Youth Soccer League (NYSL)to give their players and parents easy on-the-go access to the league's game schedules.
I designed and developed the mobile web app, with features specific to mobile devices, such as location-based features so parents can see where they are in relation to the soccer field.

Process:
-developed a UX/UI flow diagram
-designed mockup
-coded the mobile app
-initialised and deployed it using Firebase
-adding live data
-added chat functionality

 Technologies used:
 -Single Page App using Vue Js & Javascript 
 -new features in HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript to make the mobile web app look and feel like a native mobile application.
 -created a responsive design that works best at the moment for Iphone 6/7 (414 x 736)
 -Twitter Bootstrap
 -JSON
 -Firebase
